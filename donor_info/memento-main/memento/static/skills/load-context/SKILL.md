# Load Context Skill

Load shared `_context/` files scoped to the current step's location.

## Usage

```bash
python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/load-context.py <protocol-dir> <step-path>
```

The script reads all `.md` files from applicable `_context/` folders (group + protocol-wide) and outputs concatenated content. Per-step context belongs inline in the step file's `## Context` section.
