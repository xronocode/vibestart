# Changelog

All notable changes to the Memento plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [memento-workflow 1.0.2] - 2026-03-24

### Changed

- **Entry point**: replaced `serve.py` with packaged `scripts/cli.py` — enables `uvx` install from external environments (Cursor, etc.)
- **Sandbox**: consolidated process sandbox logic into `scripts/infra/sandbox.py` (single source of truth)
- **Packaging**: added `[build-system]`, `[project.scripts]` and hatch build targets for wheel/sdist distribution

### Removed

- **`serve.py`**: deleted in favor of `python -m scripts.cli` entry point

## [memento 2.0.1, memento-workflow 1.0.1] - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- **Skill frontmatter**: trimmed bloated `<example>` blocks from `research-analyst` and `design-reviewer` descriptions (~350 tokens saved per session)
- **Skill frontmatter**: fixed `model: fork` → `context: fork` (correct Claude Code syntax)
- **MCP tool descriptions**: converted `submit` and `next` Args docstrings to `Annotated` types, trimmed `open_dashboard` verbose description
- **MCP tool `shell_log`**: marked as "Debug only — bloats context" across `start`, `submit`, `next`
- **CHANGELOG.md**: moved from `memento/` to repo root (shared across both plugins)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-23

Complete rework. 120 commits, 328 files changed, +49k lines.

### Workflow Engine

New `memento-workflow` plugin — a stateful MCP-based workflow engine that drives all orchestration. Replaces LLM-scripted command prompts with declarative workflow definitions.

- **9 block types**: ShellStep, LLMStep, PromptStep, GroupBlock, LoopBlock, RetryBlock, ConditionalBlock, SubWorkflow, ParallelEachBlock
- **State machine**: advance/submit cycle with checkpoints and resume from crash
- **Parallel execution**: concurrent lanes with auto-advance for shell-only paths
- **Inline SubWorkflow**: child runs with transparent proxying through parent run_id
- **Dry-run preview**: `start(dry_run=True)` returns hierarchical tree of all steps without executing anything. Uses `AdvanceHook` pattern — state machine has no dry-run knowledge
- **Dashboard**: web UI for browsing runs, viewing artifacts, comparing executions
- **670+ tests** covering all block types, resume, idempotency, edge cases

### All orchestration is now engine-driven

`/commit`, `/code-review`, `/develop`, `/process-protocol`, `/merge-protocol`, `/create-protocol` — all rewritten as workflow engine workflows. LLM acts as a relay, executing actions returned by the engine. Benefits: deterministic flow, resumable from checkpoint, parallel reviews, auto-advancing shell steps.

### Plugin split

New `memento-workflow` plugin provides the engine as an MCP server. Workflow definitions (commit, code-review, develop, etc.) stay in `memento` and call the engine via MCP tools.

### Prompt and static consolidation

- Commands and agents converted to skills (design-reviewer, research-analyst, commit, defer, load-context)
- ~15 prompt templates replaced with static files — agents, commands, workflows that don't need per-project adaptation
- Deduplicated product_brief, tech_stack, architecture prompts
- README prompt slimmed to 25-35 lines

### Developer tooling

- pyright and ruff integrated as dev dependencies with CI enforcement
- Protocol-based development in git worktrees with structured code review
- Halt directives, file-based data exchange, structured output validation
- Coverage stagnation detection in TDD loops

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

-   **`pre-update` command** in `analyze.py`: Comprehensive pre-update check combining all Step 0 detection into one call — local changes, source changes, prompt scanning, manifest classification, obsolete detection, tech-stack diff
-   **`copy-static` command** in `analyze.py`: Copy all applicable static files in one call with integrated 3-way merge for conflict-free cases, `--filter` categories, `--base-commit` for merge mode
-   **`merge --write` flag**: When merge succeeds (no conflicts), script writes merged content directly to target file — saves LLM from reading merge JSON + writing file separately
-   **Conditional evaluator**: Evaluate manifest.yaml/frontmatter expressions (`&&`, `||`, `!`, `==`, bool lookup) against project-analysis.json
-   **Frontmatter parser**: Parse `.prompt` file YAML frontmatter without PyYAML dependency
-   **Manifest parser**: Parse `static/manifest.yaml` line-by-line with conditional handling
-   **Static file classifier**: Decision-matrix classification (new/safe_overwrite/local_only/merge_needed/up_to_date/skipped_conditional)
-   **Tech stack comparator**: Compare old vs new project analyses with high/medium/low impact classification
-   **Obsolete file detector**: Find generation-plan entries with no matching plugin source
-   **163 new tests**: Full coverage for all new functions, commands, parsers, and edge cases; `pytest-cov` added as dev dependency
-   **100% coverage enforcement rule**: Changed files must reach 100% line coverage — added to testing workflow, testing hub prompt, backend/frontend testing prompts, and code review testing competency (CRITICAL severity)
-   **Coverage flags table**: Framework-specific coverage flags (pytest, jest, vitest, go test, rspec) in testing workflow and backend testing prompt

### Changed

-   **`update-environment.md`**: Step 0.2 replaced 3+ separate detection calls with single `pre-update` call; Step 4A replaced manual static file handling with single `copy-static` call; Step 4B uses `merge --write`
-   **`create-environment.md`**: Phase 2 step 2 uses `copy-static` for static files instead of manual copying
-   **`analyze-local-changes/SKILL.md`**: Added Mode 10 (Pre-Update Check) and Mode 11 (Copy Static Files) documentation; updated Mode 6 with `--write` flag
-   **`static/skills/commit/SKILL.md`**: Bumped to v1.1.0, added "CRITICAL: Bash Execution Rules" section (separate Bash calls per git command), reformatted bullets, removed `bash` from code fence language hints
-   **`testing-workflow.md`**: Added coverage flags table, coverage enforcement in Step 3 analysis, per-changed-file coverage section in report template
-   **`testing.md.prompt`**: Added "Hard rule — changed files get 100% coverage" to Coverage Goals
-   **`review/testing.md.prompt`**: Added changed-file 100% coverage to "Coverage matches risk" rule, marked as CRITICAL severity
-   **`testing-backend.md.prompt`**: Added coverage flags table by framework, enforcement note, `--cov-report=term-missing`
-   **`testing-frontend.md.prompt`**: Added coverage enforcement note
-   **`update-plan` auto-add and `--remove`**: New files are auto-inserted into the correct plan section (Guides, Workflows, etc.); `--remove` flag deletes obsolete rows
-   **Defer skill**: Added `area`/`effort` fields, list filters (`--type`, `--area`, `--priority`, `--effort`), `view` command for grouped dashboards, inline-comment stripping in frontmatter parsing

### Fixed

-   **`get_all_mb_files()` scans all file types**: Previously only scanned `*.md`, causing non-markdown files (`defer.py`, `load-context.py`) to be falsely reported as "missing" by `detect`
-   **Documentation audit**: Fixed plugin command namespacing, outdated counts, SPECIFICATION version, CUSTOMIZATION .gitignore advice; added Python 3.10+ prerequisite, PROTOCOL_WORKFLOW.md
-   **`analyze-local-changes` skill usage**: Fixed skill invocation patterns

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

-   **`/doc-gardening`** (command + workflow): Memory Bank maintenance entrypoint — link integrity, redundancy, freshness, knowledge promotion
-   **`/update-memory-bank-protocol`** (command): Post-protocol Memory Bank update from Findings (promoted from skill to command)
-   **`AGENTS.md`** wrapper: Thin redirect to `CLAUDE.md` so all agents load the same rules
-   **Harness tests**: `test_readme_prompt_is_a_map_not_a_manual`, `test_agents_wrappers_point_to_claude_md`, `test_shipped_templates_use_namespaced_gardening_commands`

### Changed

-   **Namespaced gardening commands**: shipped docs reference `/memento:fix-broken-links` and `/memento:optimize-memory-bank` instead of thin local wrappers
-   **README.md.prompt**: Slimmed from 200-400 → 120-220 line target ("map, not manual"); removed verbose examples, simplified directory tree
-   **CLAUDE.md**: Added "What matters", "Golden commands", "Mechanical invariants" sections; removed `scripts/` from directory tree
-   **Skill script paths**: All four skills (`analyze-local-changes`, `check-redundancy`, `detect-tech-stack`, `fix-broken-links`) now use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/…/scripts/` absolute paths instead of broken relative `./scripts/` references
-   **Post-generation validation**: `create-environment` Phase 3 and `update-environment` Step 5 now run `/memento:fix-broken-links` (mandatory) and verify merge stats inline
-   **Dev command rename**: `/import-knowledge` → `/import-knowledge-into-plugin` to avoid confusion with `/memento:import-knowledge`

### Removed

-   **`commands/fix-broken-links.md`**: Thin wrapper deleted — `/memento:fix-broken-links` is the only entry point
-   **`static/skills/update-memory-bank-protocol/`**: Promoted to `static/commands/update-memory-bank-protocol.md`
-   **`scripts/`** directory: Deleted `validate-links.py` (superseded by skill), `check-redundancy.py` (identical dead copy), and `README.md`

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-20

    -   Preserves user-added sections and local modifications across repeated `/update-environment` runs
    -   Conflict detection: `both_modified`, `plugin_removed_user_modified`, `both_added`, `user_deleted`
    -   Anchor-based positioning for user-added sections in merged output
-   **Protocol completeness review competency** (`review/protocol-completeness.md`): Document-specific review for protocols and specs
    -   Implementability, cross-step consistency, edge case coverage, missing pieces checklist

-   **`CUSTOMIZATION.md`**: Removed nonexistent `plugin-config.json` section and `/sync-docs` reference, fixed GitHub URLs, updated regeneration docs to describe Phase 0 options
-   **`manifest.yaml`**: Added `review/protocol-completeness.md`, new static agents/commands/workflows/skills

### Removed

-   **15 prompt templates**: Replaced by static files (see Changed above)
